# Hotel Booking Cancellation
-----
This project involves analyzing hotel booking and cancellation data to understand patterns and reasons behind cancellations. The analysis focuses on several key aspects:

  - Booking Type: The data distinguishes between two hotel typesâ€”City Hotel and Resort Hotel. It shows the total bookings and cancellations for each type, helping identify where cancellations occur more frequently.

  - Guest Type: The project explores how cancellations vary among different guest types, including couples, families, and single travelers. This gives insight into which group tends to cancel more often.

  - Room Status: A key aspect of the analysis is the role of room status (desired vs. undesired) in cancellations. It highlights cases where customers booked a desired room but had to accept an undesired one,     leading to higher cancellations.

  - Month-Wise Trends: The data is analyzed month by month to find seasonal trends in bookings and cancellations. This helps identify peak months for cancellations and allows better planning for the future.

  - Total Bookings and Cancellations: The dashboard provides an overall summary of total bookings and cancellations, giving a clear picture of the cancellation rate.
